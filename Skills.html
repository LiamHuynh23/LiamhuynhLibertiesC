                <p>I learned a lot since I started in secondary school, I had mostly experienced with using Photoshop to create something like removing object in the background, make it blur in the background, adding more filters on it will look nice etc..</p>

                <p>Angelo sent me a photo for practice, I practiced a lot and learned on my own. Also I watch few videos about Photoshop tutorials, I had to give it a try to practice and edit Angelo's photo. I edited it and added blur background behind Angelo and a bit more effect & filter.</p>

                <p>I created a small application and added a game which is called 'Rock, Paper and Scissors'into it for first time as I learned some things from Niall. I had many errors, I went through all this and figured out how it caused and fixed them. Sometimes it's hard because the system couldn't recongized or missing in coding which leads to the application won't work or run. After that, it turned out the application ran smoothly and no errors. I played it a bit and enjoyed my time with coding this application I created.</p>

                <p>I also updated a small application, I added save and load features to the game in a small application that allows you to save data file and load data file for the game including score system. This was interesting I learned and Niall showed me how to code these.</p>

                <p>I improved my programming skill a lot by learning basics and researching on online. I created new program for ATM project, there are more features that has ability to withdraw, deposit, transfer, check balances etc.. when running this program. I spent a lot of time on this, figuring out what issue and how, fixes errors mostly. This was very interesting I played a bit.</p>
