                <h2>Monday 22nd January 2024 (First Week)</h2>
                <p>
                    An FIT employer discussed with me and all other people. They gave me the brief about the bakery project and what I do with this project. I also teamed up with some people in a separate group for the project, they were talking about the brief and ask us to choose what role we want. I wanted to choose two or three roles which are Software, Company Website or Branding but I had to choose ONLY ONE role I go with. Unfortunately, it turned out that all roles are full since other people in my team have selected roles expect for Budget and A.I.
                    I wasn’t sure which one I want to pick but it was a bit hard for me and I asked them, they explained what you do with Budget and A.I role.
                    I also took A.I role as I work after I finally made my decision and go for A.I.
                    I discussed with Daniel who work with me together about A.I like how we use A.I model to improve our small business and project, how it can improve customer experience and etc… on Microsoft Teams.
                    We had to wait and ask for budget team and software team about this we came up with the ideas.
                    After that, we came back to main meeting and watched the presentation about Agile Methodology and Waterfall that was main thing I learned about.
                    The most challenge is I have faced was A.I but there are some ways to overcome this challenge.
                    And other difficult challenge we had to overcome is Communication.

                <h2>Tuesday 23nd January 2024 (First Week)</h2>
                <p>
                    I continued to work on our project for Bakery and saved some important points from our previous conversations with Daniel. I typed up some ideas we came up with and important points on Word Document after I created a word document.
                    Daniel was researching on the theme related to A.I and suggest us to make few slides and merge it with others on PowerPoint.
                    I discussed with Daniel about new ideas and brainstorming, I came up with new idea that we should use A.I to track and monitor the advertisement and analysis which helps our small business as well.
                    I researched more about cloud storage services, so there are 3 cloud storage services I found which are AWS Cloud Storage Service, Dropbox for Business and Google Drive for Business, we need to rent the cloud storage server because of Daniel’s idea that he suggested that we can create a personalized loyalty program to make special offers to the clients based on previous choices, but for this, we need to organize the data base with our client information. Also, if we consider this, we should take more storage space.
                    With this, I thought it would be perfect if we have enough storage or more that allows us to store huge amounts of data with our client information.
                    With Daniel’s idea, I thought we should use A.I to organize the data with our client information which makes our small business easier.
                    I also thought of new idea that we make survey, give survey to customers, and receive their feedback to improve and change things. We use A.I to organize the data and survey, calculate all and output results, we can look at it and make things better and towards bright future.

                <h2>Wednesday 24th January 2024 (First Week)</h2>
                <p>
                    I discussed with Angelo and Daniel about more ideas that could be useful for business and improve the quality and the products with using A.I
                    They came up with three ideas that are Digital Marketing, Energy Efficiency and Labour Optimization after researching more information.
                    I thought that one of their ideas is great because that could reduce the energy cost with using A.I to optimize and more efficiently especially reducing energy consumption.
                    We thought that Digital Marketing could improve the advertisement and it makes our business easier because they can use A.I to monitoring it in real time and analysis & organize all data based on advertisement and it also shows how many views they reached to ads from us, the amount of link clicks and audience details etc…
                    We added three ideas to a Word Document I made, for note.
                    I talked with an FIT employee on One-on-One meeting all about what I do with this project, ideas and etc.

                <p>
                    After that, I recently discussed with Jansuh from Marketing & Awareness team about one of the ideas we came up with.
                    She told me that she and her team could use our cloud storage service to gather information which makes it easier. Stamps could make the part about collecting information.
                    I was thinking about that one and went to ask Daniel about Jansuh’s suggestion. Daniel agreed it on that, we added her suggestion. We can divide all our products on categories and provide offers based on that as well. We can integrate it into the app or website. For example, I bought a croissant and collected a stamp on it, that they use to collect information that I received a stamp. The city where our bakery business operates is a small one, there is major amount of people & elderly people and provide discount on next croissant or other thing from the same category.
                    The one in our group suggested that we can use OneDrive instead, the subscription have Microsoft Office and 1TB of space included because our small business would need Microsoft Word, Excel and etc as their requirements. It is cheaper and less organization problem.
                    We agreed each other and did go with that suggestion. We also added that suggestion on the note.

                <p>
                    In the morning, we started to create a PowerPoint for our project and worked on that since we finished brainstorming and discussed about A.I with our AI team.
                    I typed up few ideas on there and added few pictures on three slides after I was looking for some pictures that match A.I and Bakery on Google to add them as well. Our group were working on each slide on PowerPoint at around that time too.
                    At afternoon, I went on main meeting where all people were there. An FIT employee talked about Cybersecurity and her experience where she works Cybersecurity job etc.
                    I learned that something is interesting, she uses both Python and SQL code language for Cybersecurity. Also, she talked a lot about hacking, the solution for network, fixes security and improve more security and protection around the network server, or data centre. I thought that it turned out there was a lot of information she talked about and answer people's questions etc.
                    And after that, I came back to our group meeting. An FIT employee came to check in and asked us what we do today and how it did go etc.
